The database contains data from aerial surveys for dugongs undertaken by JCU in nine broad regions along the Australian coast since 1984: Shark Bay (WA), Exmouth (includes Ningaloo) (WA); Pilbara (WA); the Gulf of Carpentaria (NT and QLD); Torres Strait (QLD); northern Great Barrier Reef (QLD); southern Great Barrier Reef (QLD); Hervey Bay (QLD), and Moreton Bay (QLD). The map below shows the spatial coverage of these broad regions as used in the database.

An individual survey can cover part of a region, a whole region, or several regions. For each survey, the database contains, when available:
* information related to ‘raw’ (unprocessed) dugong sightings,
* estimates of relative dugong population abundance for each block surveyed,
* flight and weather summaries,
* links to downloadable spatial data on transects flown and on raw dugong sightings (ESRI shapefile .shp format),
* links to downloadable reports (.pdf format),
and more…

The Dugong Aerial Survey Database is a relational database, using MySQL coding language to allow custom queries on data.
