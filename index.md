The database contains data from aerial surveys for dugongs undertaken by JCU in nine broad regions along the Australian coast since 1984: Shark Bay (WA), Exmouth (includes Ningaloo) (WA); Pilbara (WA); the Gulf of Carpentaria (NT and QLD); Torres Strait (QLD); northern Great Barrier Reef (QLD); southern Great Barrier Reef (QLD); Hervey Bay (QLD), and Moreton Bay (QLD). The map below shows the spatial coverage of these broad regions as used in the database.

An individual survey can cover part of a region, a whole region, or several regions. For each survey, the database contains, when available:
* information related to ‘raw’ (unprocessed) dugong sightings,
* estimates of relative dugong population abundance for each block surveyed,
* flight and weather summaries,
* links to downloadable spatial data on transects flown and on raw dugong sightings (ESRI shapefile .shp format),
* links to downloadable reports (.pdf format),
and more…

The Dugong Aerial Survey Database is a relational database, using MySQL coding language to allow custom queries on data.

The Dugong Aerial Survey Database was co-funded by JCU, the Australian Marine Mammal Centre, the Australian Antarctic Division of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (formerly Department of the Environment). All surveys in the database were undertaken by JCU and funded by various agencies as indicated in relevant reports. JCU and the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Dugongs (Dugong dugon) and their Habitats throughout their Range (UNEP/CMS) have supported the maintenance and updating of the database in 2022-2024. The database project is led by Helene Marsh (TropWATER, JCU), was designed by Steven van der Valk (formerly eResearch Centre, JCU), maintained by Susan Sobtzick (formerly TropWATER, JCU) until 2022 and by Mélanie Hamel (TropWATER, JCU) since 2022.

Resources on Dugong Aerial Surveys in Australia
Reports for all dugong aerial surveys included in this database will contain the information needed for most applications. These are the individual reports for all dugong aerial surveys conducted by JCU and are organised by region.

Inventory of dugong aerial surveys in Australia contains general information on dugong aerial surveys conducted in Australia up to 2023 (including but not limited to those in the database).

If the information you are after is not found in the resources above, you may need to access data in JCU’s Dugong Aerial Survey Database.
